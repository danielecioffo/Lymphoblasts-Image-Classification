# Classification of B-Cell Lymphoblasts versus Normal Cells in White Blood Cells Microscopic Images
The goal of this project, inspired by the ISBI 2019 C-NMC Challenge, was to develop a deep learning architecture that can solve the classification problem in cancer cell imaging. The full documentation can be found [here](Report.pdf).

## Introduction
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the development of many immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts. It is the most common type of leukemia in children, particularly those between the ages of two and five, and the most common cause of death from pediatric cancers. Treatment depends on the type of ALL, age at diagnosis, and other factors. In any case, early detection and diagnosis are key to a good change for a cure. In order to reach a decisive conclusion for the diagnosis of the disease and the degree of progression, it is of paramount importance to identify malignant cells with high accuracy. The task of distinguishing lymphoblasts from normal white blood cells under the microscope is however generally challenging, as morphologically the images of the two cell types appear similar. Computer-aided tools can be extremely useful in automating the process of identifying malignant cells and in helping pathologist and oncologist make quicker and data-driven inferences
